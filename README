Seek is a vim plugin that aims to make inline navigation effortless. The motion seek, summoned with s by default, is similar to f, but instead of one it expects two characters. This greatly reduces the possible matches within the line and mostly allows you to get anywhere in a line with three keystrokes. Your cursor is left off at the first character typed, so if you seek to "th" your cursor will now be at "t". The forward seek motion is complemented by S, which seeks backwards. Additional useful motions are provided, most optional, please see the github.com/goldfeld/vim-seek readme.
